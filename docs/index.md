 ## Introudction
 In this document I will go over the steps I took to learn both Pickling and File Exceptions from outside sources. I will discuss what I did to test these features in my code, and also why I choose each source. 
 
 ## Exception Handling
 I started with file exceptions as I thought it would be best to show errors first in the code before trying to do pickling. Based on the examples I saw in the lecture videos, I wanted to try something different with the exception handling errors and tried both a try except without an exception variable and one with. But first I started to research python exception handling on the internet. 
I found this source from a website called The Python Guru (ThePythonGuru, https://thepythonguru.com/python-exception-handling/ , 2022) that showed many different examples of exception handling. Reading through this blog I found it to be similar to the exception handling examples in the course though with a different take. Therefore I thought this to be a good site to try a couple of exception handling errors. 
Seeing the first example in Figure 1, I thought I could incorporate the file exception error into my code right away to show an example of not finding the right text file.
